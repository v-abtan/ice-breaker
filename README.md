Many good things in life come about through happenstance. Icebreaker enables happenstance for your team. Icebreaker is a Teams bot that helps the whole team get closer by pairing up members every week at random to meet for coffee, burgers, pizza, or a walk around the block. The bot does the heavy lifting of finding a new person to meet with each week, and aids in scheduling the meetup.

Icebreaker works really well for cultivating small, interest-based communities within your organization. For example, an organization may leverage this bot for a DevOps interest group to help facilitate organic cross-pollination of ideas and best practices. Another common use case is new employees’ cohorts to help employees learn more about each other and assimilate better in the new environment.

## What's new

> **IMPORTANT** If you are using the initial release of Icebreaker, please upgrade to version 2. This is especially important of you are using the app in a team with more than 5,000 members. The API used to get the team roster in version 1 does not support large teams, has been deprecated, and will no longer work in the future.

#### Version 2 (March 2021)
- Update from version 3 of the Bot Framework SDK to the latest version 4
- Fetch team roster using the paged members API, to avoid failures with large team sizes. See the deprecation notice [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/blogs/changes-coming-to-microsoft-teams-bot-apis-for-fetching-team-chat-members/).
    - If you are using Icebreaker in a large team, remember to review the `MaxPairUpsPerTeam` app service setting.
- Store secrets and connection strings in Azure Key Vault
